# FoundationaLLM CoreClient samples

## Getting started

> ![!TIP]
> This folder includes Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use the FoundationaLLM CoreClient SDK to interact with the FoundationaLLM API.
> For the best experience, we recommend installing the [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) for Visual Studio Code.
