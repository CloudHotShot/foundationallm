# FoundationaLLM Prompt

FoundationaLLM Prompt is a .NET library for the Prompt resource provider. The resource provider provides a consistent way
to manage prompts across a FoundationaLLM instance. It is consumed by the various layers of the FoundationaLLM
application stack. Reference this library in your project if you need to directly manage prompts. Otherwise, you can use the
`FoundationaLLM.Management` library to manage prompts by calling into the Management API in your FoundationaLLM instance.
