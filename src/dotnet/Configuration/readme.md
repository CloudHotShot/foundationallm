# Foundationa**LLM** Configuration

Foundationa**LLM** Configuration is a .NET library for the Configuration resource provider. The resource provider provides a consistent way
to manage and access configuration settings across a FoundationaLLM deployment. It is consumed by the various layers of the FoundationaLLM
application stack. Reference this library in your project if you need to directly access configuration settings. Otherwise, you can use the
`FoundationaLLM.Management` library to manage configuration settings by calling into the Management API in your deployed environment.
