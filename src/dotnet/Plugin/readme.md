# FoundationaLLM Plugin

FoundationaLLM Plugin is a .NET library for the Plugin resource provider. The resource provider provides a consistent way
to manage plugins across a FoundationaLLM instance. It is consumed by the various layers of the FoundationaLLM
application stack. Reference this library in your project if you need to directly manage plugins. Otherwise, you can use the
`FoundationaLLM.Management` library to manage plugins by calling into the Management API in your FoundationaLLM instance.
