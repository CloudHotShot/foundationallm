# FoundationaLLM DataSource

FoundationaLLM DataSource is a .NET library for the DataSource resource provider. The resource provider provides a consistent way
to manage data sources across a FoundationaLLM instance. It is consumed by the various layers of the FoundationaLLM
application stack. Reference this library in your project if you need to directly manage data sources. Otherwise, you can use the
`FoundationaLLM.Management` library to manage data sources by calling into the Management API in your FoundationaLLM instance.
