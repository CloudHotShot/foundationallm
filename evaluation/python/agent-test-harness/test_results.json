My Fellow Americans. \nIn January 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation. \nHe said, “I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.” \nHitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe. \nPresident Roosevelt’s purpose was to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary moment.    \nFreedom and democracy were under assault in the world. \nTonight I come to the same chamber to address the nation. \nNow it is we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. \nAnd yes, my purpose tonight is to both wake up this Congress, and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. \nNot since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today. \nWhat makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack, both at home and overseas, at the very same time. \nOverseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.\n```",
