# Exposed API Documentation

FoundationaLLM (FLLM) exposes two convenient API interfaces that enable developers to quickly build Generative AI applications.

- [Core API:](core-api.md) The Core API supports direct completion requests against FLLM's agents.
- [Management API:](management-api.md) The Management API abstracts FLLM's configuration, enabling programmatic setup of agents, datasources, and prompts.
  - The [Management UI](../management-ui/management-ui.md) implements a frontend interface on top of the Management API, simplifying common agent configuration tasks
