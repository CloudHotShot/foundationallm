## Pre-release changes that will affect future releases.

1. Vectorization resource stores use a unique collection name, `Resources`. They also add a new top-level property named `DefaultResourceName`.
2. The items in the `index_references` collection have an property incorrectly named `type` which was renamed to `index_entry_id`.
3. New gateway API, requires the following app configurations:
   - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:GatewayAPI:APIUrl`
   - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:GatewayAPI:APIKey` (with secret `foundationallm-apis-gatewayapi-apikey`)
   - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:GatewayAPI:AppInsightsConnectionString` (with secret `foundationallm-app-insights-connection-string`)
   - `FoundationaLLM:Gateway:AzureOpenAIAccounts`
4. The `AgentFactory` and `AgentFactoryAPI` classes have been renamed to `Orchestration` and `OrchestrationAPI`, respectively. The following App Config settings need to be replaced in existing environments:

    - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:AgentFactoryAPI:APIKey` -> `FoundationaLLM:APIs:OrchestrationAPI:APIKey`
    - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:AgentFactoryAPI:APIUrl` -> `FoundationaLLM:APIs:OrchestrationAPI:APIUrl`
    - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:AgentFactoryAPI:AppInsightsConnectionString` -> `FoundationaLLM:APIs:OrchestrationAPI:AppInsightsConnectionString`
    - `FoundationaLLM:Events:AzureEventGridEventService:Profiles:AgentFactoryAPI` -> `FoundationaLLM:Events:AzureEventGridEventService:Profiles:OrchestrationAPI`
    - `FoundationaLLM:APIs:AgentFactoryAPI:ForceHttpsRedirection` -? `FoundationaLLM:APIs:OrchestrationAPI:ForceHttpsRedirection`

5. The following Key Vault secrets need to be replaced in existing environments:

    - `foundationallm-apis-agentfactoryapi-apikey` -> `foundationallm-apis-orchestrationapi-apikey`

\* There is an upgrade script available that migrates these settings and secrets to their new names.
